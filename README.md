# Customer-Churn-and-Segmentation-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn and segmentation for an e-commerce business. By understanding the patterns and behaviors that lead to customer churn, we can develop strategies to retain customers and improve overall business performance. The analysis includes building predictive models, clustering customers into segments, and proposing targeted retention strategies.

## Objectives
Develop a predictive model to forecast customer churn.
Identify key factors contributing to customer churn.
Segment customers based on their behavior and demographics.
Propose and implement customer retention strategies tailored to each segment.

## Data Description
The dataset includes comprehensive information about customer demographics, purchase behavior, and interactions with the online store. Key variables include:

Demographics: Gender, Marital Status, City Tier
Behavioral: Preferred Payment Method, Order Frequency, Average Order Value
Customer Interactions: Website Visits, Email Opens, Customer Support Interactions

## Methodology
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.
Standardize values (e.g., 'Phone' to 'Mobile Phone').
Encode categorical variables.
Churn Analysis:

Explore relationships between churn and various features.
Calculate and visualize correlations.
Segmentation Analysis:

Apply K-Means clustering to identify customer segments.
Predictive Modeling:

Use Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Evaluate performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

## Results and Findings

Churn Analysis
Churn Distribution: A significant portion of customers are churning.
Demographics and Churn:
Gender: Slight differences in churn rates.
Marital Status: Certain marital statuses are more prone to churn.
City Tier: Churn rates vary across different city tiers.
Behavior and Churn:
Preferred Login Device: Device type impacts churn.
Preferred Payment Mode: Payment preferences affect churn.
Order Category: Certain categories show higher churn rates.
Engagement and Churn:
Tenure: Longer tenure reduces churn likelihood.
Satisfaction Score: Higher satisfaction correlates with lower churn.
Order Amount Hike: Increased spending reduces churn.
Customer Segments
High-Value Loyal Customers: High tenure, high satisfaction, frequent purchases.
Price-Sensitive Occasional Buyers: Medium tenure, moderate satisfaction, infrequent purchases.
New Customers: First-time buyers who haven't established purchase patterns.
At-Risk Customers: Show signs of declining engagement or potential churn.

## Retention Strategies

Loyalty Programs: Reward loyal customers with discounts and exclusive offers.
Personalized Recommendations: Leverage purchase history and browsing data to suggest relevant products and deals.
Exceptional Customer Service: Provide prompt and helpful support. Address customer issues quickly and efficiently.
Targeted Email Campaigns: Segment customers and send personalized email promotions based on their preferences and behavior.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Churn Rate: Decrease by 10% within 6 months.
Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT): Increase by 15% within 6 months.
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Increase by 20% within 6 months.
Repeat Purchase Rate: Increase by 15% within 6 months.
Engagement Rate: Achieve 30% within 3 months.
Net Promoter Score (NPS): Increase by 10 points within 6 months.

## Conclusion

By analyzing customer churn and segmentation, we can develop targeted retention strategies to reduce churn, increase customer satisfaction, and improve overall business performance. The predictive models and segmentation analysis provide valuable insights that can guide data-driven decision-making.
